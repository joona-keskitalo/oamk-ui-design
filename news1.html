    <p>NiP have pulled off the upset in the grand final of IEM Oakland, defeating FaZe in a best-of-five marathon 3-2 (Cobblestone 16-10, Inferno 7-16, Train 16-10, Overpass 6-16, Cache 16-10).</p>

<p>The best-of-five showdown started on Cobblestone, with NiPputting up a 3-0 lead at the start as Counter-Terrorists, but it was FaZe who came out on top of the first gunrounds on the back of clutches from Nikola "NiKo" Kovač and Finn "karrigan"Andersen for an eventual 6-3 scoreline.
The momentum started swinging back in NiP's favor once they brought forth their double AWP setup, with William "draken" Sundin clutching a 1v1 along the way. With it, the Swedes pulled off six rounds in a row for a solid 9-6 half.</p>

<p>An A attack in the second pistol pushed them to double digits while FaZe replied with the following forcebuy,
 but Patrik "f0rest" Lindberg's triples in round three and four of the second half gave the control over to NiP once more.
 The European squad tried to hold off at 13-7 but never managed to string rounds together despite individual heroics from Ladislav "GuardiaN" Kovács and Olof "olofmeister" Kajbjer, as the rounds kept going back and forth until NiP emerged victorious 16-10.</p>

 <p>FaZe kicked off Inferno with a 5-0 lead on the offense thanks to rain's quad-kill in the pistol round and a triple in the first gunround. The next three went the other way, this time with REZ pulling much of the weight with three kills and later a 1v2 clutch. From there on, the half was in the hands of karrigan's roster, who clinched six of the remaining seven rounds, two of which after clutches from GuardiaN and olofmeister.</p>
