        <p>Answering fan questions in a Reddit Ask Me Anything (AMA) post, Overwatch League commissioner Nate Nanzer discussed the league's future expansion. Europe and Brazil, in particular, are two areas of focus for future seasons, Nanzer said. "Europe is a very important region with a ton of great players," Nanzer wrote. "In fact, there are 30 European players in the Overwatch League this season. Europe is also a key focus for us as we look to expand the league to add more teams in future seasons. Brazil is also an area of focus for us, and a country that we think can definitely support an Overwatch League team in the future."</p>

        <h2>Elements Pro Gaming drops their squad, but does't give up on Dota 2 yet"</h2>

        <p>Elements Pro decided to drop their Dota 2 squad and try again with a new team, not giving up on the Dota 2 scene. Ever since forming the roster in September EPG dropped out of the Dota 2 scene radar, unsurprisingly disbanding after lack of results.</p>

        <img src="img/features-5.jpg" alt="News-1">
        <p>DreamHack Winter 2017 is not a large international LAN. It has a good mix of teams including: BIG, Gambit, Na`Vi, EnVyUs, North Academy, Heroic, mouz and Rise Nation. It feels like an undercard event to the ESL Proleague Finals that are set to happen two days after this ends. But for Gambit and Na`Vi in particular, this is an incredibly important event to win. After all this was where it all started for Gambit and their former in-game leader Daniil “Zeus” Teslenko.</p>
